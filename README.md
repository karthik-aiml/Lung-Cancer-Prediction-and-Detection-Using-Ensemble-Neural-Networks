# Lung Cancer Prediction and Detection Using Ensemble Neural Networks

This project involves building a high-recall medical data and image processing system for lung cancer prediction and detection. The system uses an ensemble of neural networks to achieve high accuracy and recall rates.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict and detect lung cancer using a combination of ensemble algorithms and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DCNN). The system processes patient data and CT scan images to provide accurate predictions.

**Stages of the Project:**
1. **Stage 1:** Patient data training and prediction using an ensemble algorithm (Decision Tree + AdaBoost + MLP).
2. **Stage 2:** CT scan image cancer detection using 3DCNN + RBF, resulting in high accuracy and recall.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
